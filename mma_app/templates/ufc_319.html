Model vs Odds:
Model leans slightly toward Du Plessis, while betting markets favor Chimaev. That creates a potential value opportunity on Du Plessis at +140. If you believe model logic, backing Du Plessis offers value 💸💰.

Predicted Winner: Du Plessis retains title (by decision or late stoppage, given his Power & recent dominance).

🗑 Co-Main Event
Jared Cannonier vs. Michael Page

MMA Math:

Cannonier: consistent finishes, veteran ranking (~#7); Page: moving up, solid striking but less UFC track. Model gives Cannonier edge.

Take: Model aligns with betting. No strong discrepancy → I’d side with Cannonier at value odds +155, expecting his experience and power to prevail.

🗚️ Other notable picks
Jessica Andrade vs. Loopy Godinez: Andrade returns to strawweight after losses at flyweight. Model scoring gives her slight edge due to experience and recent struggles indicating urgency. Betting odds unclear here; likely close. Lean Andrade by decision or late finish.

Chase Hooper vs. Alexander Hernandez: Hooper undefeated in UFC (~5 wins), active finishes; Hernandez more experienced but model favors Hooper.

Edson Barboza vs. Drakkar Klose: Barboza veteran striker vs. Klose who has KO power but inconsistent. Model slightly to Barboza via decision. Betting spreads TBD.

Geoff Neal vs. Carlos Prates: Both coming off losses, model slightly favors Neal for experience in tougher fights.

Karine Silva vs. JJ Aldrich: Silva lost last fight, Aldrich steady but unspectacular. Model gives Silva minor edge for earlier finishing pedigree.
